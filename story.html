                my story
            </h1>
    
            
            <h2>Born in India</h2>
            <img src="Images/Indian Railways.JPG" alt="Railway station in Chattisgarh, India" style="width:100%; ">
            
            <p>I was born in a small town in the centre of India. My parents grew up in two different states and had very humble beginnings. Being born in India exposed me to a whole set of rich cultures, languages, and customs for which I’m forever grateful. The picture above is from the railway station of the town I was born in. Travelling through India using trains is a fond memory of my childhood.</p>
                        
            <br>
            <h2>Grew up in the Middle East </h2>
            <img src="Images/Muscat.jpg" alt="Muscat, Oman" style="width:100%;">
            
            <p>I consider myself very lucky to have grown up in the Middle East. I spent my childhood growing up in Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. My favourite memories from this time include shawarmas, tennis, cricket, football, and some more shawarma. The picture above is from the beautiful capital of Oman, Muscat.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h2>Moved to Toronto!</h2>
            <img src="Images/Toronto.jpg" alt="Toronto skyline" style="width: 100%;">
            
            <p>I moved to Canada in high school and ended up going to the University of Toronto where I studied Mechanical Engineering. Studying engineering at UofT was an intense experience to say the least. The people I met there and the challenges I had to overcome have played a huge role in making me the person I’ve become. I’m bullish that our graduating class will change the world!</p>
                
            <br>
            <h2>America and beyond!</h2>
            <img src="images/San Francisco.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" style="width: 100%;">
            
            <p>After undergrad I had the immense opportunity to work for a Sequoia backed startup called Setter in San Francisco. This was another trajectory defining experience that really deepened my interest in tech. This experience led me to Microsoft where I’m currently a Product Manager on the digital retail team.</p>
